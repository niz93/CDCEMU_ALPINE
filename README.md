### Original readme of Oliver Mueller

This is a heavily modified library forked from:
https://github.com/Olstyle/MBus

The changes include:
* added several new protocol messages, including more detailed changing messages and error messages
* introduced interrupts to handle receiving of messages
* introduced messages specific to Alpine 7909 and potentially other early Alpine headunits
* reformatted the code to fit the Google c++ styleguide I'm more used to

Since commits in October 2023, the library has been developed and tested on Teensy 4.0/4.1.


### Original readme of Oliver Mueller

This is an Arduino library to emulate Alpines M-Bus which is used on a variety of car radios.
You can send and receive messages as well as send special messages which trick the radio in believing it communicates with an cd changer.

Electrically, you'd want to have a piece of circuitry to split the send and receive line which is shown here(not my website):

I also used this site for reference on the bus itself.
